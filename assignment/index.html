        <li>What's the correct way to deal with really long lines in a code statement? For example, this one extends way beyond atom's guideline at 80 characters and I had some unwieldly lines in part 3 of the assignment that I couldn't shorten without creating additional variables or starting a new line midstatement.</li>
